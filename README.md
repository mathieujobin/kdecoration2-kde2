A quick port of "KDE 2" window decoration to KDE Plasma 5

To install do the following in your terminal:

        git clone git://github.com/repos-holder/kdecoration2-kde2
        cd kdecoration2-kde2
        cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
        make install

It should be then available in System Settings -> Application Style -> Window Decorations
